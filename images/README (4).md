# 🎵 Music Genre Analysis & Recommendation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates a **music dataset** to identify trends across various genres and their unique characteristics.  
It also implements a **basic recommendation mechanism** that suggests similar tracks by comparing extracted features.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- Downloaded and preprocessed the dataset directly in the workflow.  
- Visualized the distribution of different music genres.  
- Extracted statistical and audio-related features for deeper understanding.  
- Built a simple recommendation system using feature similarity.  
- Generated visual insights such as genre distribution, feature correlations, and prediction results.  

## 📊 Visual Outputs
